* Fixes for running on 64bit Linux and MinGW on windows
 
Changes in 4.4.3hb
  7-Oct-2016

* Fix writing VAR/VFC records
  In case the record length was the last word in a buffer, the fixed
  control field wasn't correctly handled: it wasn't removed and so the
  next record length was contructed out of data.

  27-Jul-2016

* Fix typecmp;
  don't call typecmp for an explizit FILE list;
  print a message when files are ignored (because they match one of the file
  types in the extensions list - in typecmp);
  change the long name and help text for option -e to make it clearer

Changes in 4.4.3hb
  3-Mar-2016

* Skip XOR data processing which fixes bugs, which showed as
  - missing files in the -t aka /list output
  - "Snark: invalid data header word 0: ddd word 1: ddd"
  - "Warning: unrecognized record type..."

* Write debug output to stderr

* Re-group selective debug output - undocumented -Dxxx:
  #define D_BLKREC   0x1
  #define D_FILE     0x2
  #define D_VBN      0x4
  #define D_IO       0x8
  #define D_SUM	    0x10
  #define D_TIME    0x20
  #define D_FILE_X  0x40
  #define D_VBN_X   0x80
  #define D_SUM_X  0x100
  
* Change/add some debug output for blocks.

* Fix IDENT linker option in build.com.

* Make sure STDIN/OUT/ERR_FILENO is defined for VMS builds.

  22-Aug-2013

* Add a new output option for extracting files.

* Allow stdin and stdout for save sets and output files.

* Adjust usage and allow the listed '?' as option; change
  the format of the usage line and the grouping of the
  options.

* In the Makefile, improve handling of vmsbackupver.h and pdf tools.


Changes in 4.4.3
  Hoff; http://www.hoffmanlabs.com
  25-Feb-2011

* Fixed a bug in the swizzling routines that showed up in
  a big-endian build on Solaris.  No little-endian changes
  and no other changes.

* This version does NOT contain any ODS-5 symbolic link 
  (SYMLINK) support.  SYMLINKs are first optionally available 
  on OpenVMS V8.3.


Changes in 4.4.2

* Fixed a typo in the usage text.  No (other) code changes.


Changes in 4.4.1

  23-Oct-2009

* Documentation updates only.  No code changes.


Changes in 4.4.0
  Hoff; http://www.hoffmanlabs.com
  26-Sep-2009

* changes for a clean build under gcc 4.2.1 on Mac OS X 10.6
  Snow Leopard and for HP C V7.3-009 on OpenVMS Alpha V8.3.

* The incompletely-implemented DCL CLD command-parsing support 
  has been stubbed out.  The source code remains present within 
  this kit, but is stubbed out, and will be removed in the next
  version.  When vmsbackup is built on OpenVMS, the same UI and 
  the same switch options used with Unix platforms are present.

* improved the help text display when getoptlong is unavailable.



Changes in 4.3.1:
  Hoff; http://www.hoffmanlabs.com
  19-Oct-2008

* Retrofit large-file changes; promote size files to long long.

* Conditionalize altzone to Solaris.  (Partially removes GMT fix.)

Changes in 4.3.0:
  K. Clark CSC/STSci
  08-Oct-2008

* Port to SUNWstudio-11 C - replace "$" in variable names
   with "_", fix compile-time errors, and memory overflow errors.

* Add extra tape mark skip to get past tape header when run on Solaris 10.

* Add close statement for extracted files.

* Update time_vms_to_unix to convert to local time instead of GMT
   time.

* Time stamp extracted files with original create and mod times.

* Add comments to document backup file structure.
 
Changes in 4.2.1: 
  Hoff; http://www.hoffmanlabs.com
  05-Apr-2008

* Incorporates all of Kevin Handy's changes from 4.2.

* remove the fabdef.h included in 4.2 to avoid including
  OpenVMS definition modules here.  We now include our own
  symbols that we use, or closely related to same; these
  parallel information from sys$examples:back*.h files and
  from specific other *def files, but do not include same.

* conditionalize references to descrip.h and other OpenVMS
  files to use __VMS or __VAXC, as appropriate.

* fix various compile-time errors, fix missing includes, and
  re-write the makefile.

* add limited ODS-5 support.  Files imported from ODS-5 volumes
  are no longer forced to lowercase; preserve the casing.

* add a debug mask to --debug, and enable --debug at all times.
  This mechanism is now present unconditionally in all builds,
  allowing diagnostics to be immediately selected as needed.

* Removed RSTS BACKUP hooks.

* added portable date-handling code.  (uses long long int and ll
  syntax available in current OpenVMS C and Unix gcc compilers.)

* made --full output closer to OpenVMS BACKUP /FULL output.

* contend with multiple summary structures in savesets.

* add to the documented list of file types that won't (by 
  default) be unpacked.  These are platform-specific files,
  and are not portable.

* update man page

Changes since version 4.1: (kth@srv.net)

* Use the include files <descrip.h> and <fabdef.h> instead of many
hard coded constants. It must now be compiled with the
'-fdollars-in-identifiers' flag because of this.

* Added handling of dates/times. It now needs to be linked against
the 'starlet' library.

* Add file creation date to the -t printout.

* Modify the -F option so that it more closely resembles a DIR/FULL
listing from a real VMS 5.5-2 system, and add several missing
items (Dates, file id, various attributes, etc).

* Added a '-D' flag so that I didn't have to keep switching between
the DEBUG version and the regular version (Only does anything when
the program is compiled with DEBUG defined).

* Rewrote the Makefile because I couldn't get the original to work.

* Increased the size of the date strings from 23 to 24 to make room
for the terminating NULL.

* Modified so it doesn't die when given a RSTS/E save set.

* Able to use getopt_long for long option names.

Changes since version 3.0.1:

* Merged in changes from version 3.1 from S.J. Tappin of the
University of Birmingham.  .HLB is now on the list of file extensions
which are ignored by default (along with .TLB, .EXE, etc.).  Filenames
are matched in a case-insensitive fashion.  Added -B option to
extract files in binary mode.

* Merged in the -b change from Timothy Stark's version 4.0.  This lets
one set the blocksize.

Changes from version 3.0 to version 3.0.1:

* The output from listings now more closely approximates the output of
VMS BACKUP/LIST.

* There is now a version which runs on VMS and accepts (a few) of the
qualifiers of BACKUP.

* Can read savesets on disk (created with the /SAVE_SET qualifier) as
well as on tape.

* More portable (in particular, no longer depends on things like
#ifdef sun to determined byte-order, and no longer depends on the
size of host data types like short and long).

Changes which were in version 3.0:

(Version 3.0 is also known as "v07i099: Read VMS backup tapes"
(read-vms-backs) from the comp.sources.unix archive)

* See the bottom of the ChangeLog file.
