This tool reads an OpenVMS BACKUP saveset (archive) file on Mac OS X
(10.5, 10.6) and on OpenVMS systems, and has occasionally been built
and used on Sun Solaris, Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

BACKUP savesets are the standard archival mechanism used for Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC), Compaq and HP OpenVMS operating system
environments. 

This tool processes the saveset itself and extracts the constituent
files onto the local operating system.  It does not attempt to decode
OpenVMS RMS file formats into host-local file formats, including but
not limited to Variable with Fixed Control (VFC) sequential files, 
indexed files or other RMS file formats used on OpenVMS systems.

Please see the NEWS file for status, contact information, updates
and related; the README file.

See vmsbackup.pdf (and other file extensions) for the documentation.
